# f4 Plugin Architecture (F4-RPC) & API

`f4` plugins speak **F4-RPC**: a small, highly efficient request/response protocol carried in **MessagePack**. Method names look like `Plugin.Init`, `VFS.ReadDir`, and `Host.Log`. `MessagePack` was chosen over JSON-RPC to keep serialization overhead and network latency low for large `ReadDir` chunks.

One protocol, several transports. The same plugin can run in its own process, communicating over `stdin`/`stdout`, or inside `f4` on an embedded interpreter. Nothing above the transport changes, so a plugin moves between them without being rewritten.

## 1. The Transports

**Subprocess.** `f4` launches an executable and talks to it over pipes. Write the plugin in Go, Python, Rust, C++, Node.js or LuaJIT; anything that can read and write MessagePack on stdio works. The plugin is a native OS process with unrestricted access to the network, native libraries and the filesystem.

**Embedded Lua.** `f4` runs a `.lua` plugin on a built-in interpreter, with no system Lua and no rocks to install. The plugin is a single file. `require('f4rpc')` resolves to a preloaded module, so a script written for the subprocess transport runs here unmodified.

**Embedded wasm.** `f4` runs a `.wasm` plugin on a built-in WebAssembly runtime. The guest is a WASI command reading F4-RPC from stdin and writing it to stdout, exactly as a subprocess plugin does, so the same source builds either way. It is the only transport that is genuinely a sandbox: the guest gets no filesystem, only stdio, a clock and a random source. Native calls reach it through `Host.FFI.*` (see `FFI.md`).

## 2. The F4-RPC Object Model & API

Unlike classic terminal file managers, the `f4` plugin API is strictly **Data-Centric**, split into VFS/Drive operations, Editor Syntax Highlighting, and UI/Global actions.

### A. Virtual Filesystems: Drives vs. Providers

`f4` supports two distinct ways of mounting virtual file systems:
1.  **Drives (External & Internal):** Standalone file systems mounted under a specific label. They are registered during `Plugin.Init` (e.g., returning `{ Drives = { "My Lua Drive" } }`) and appear in the `Alt+F1/F2` drive selection menus.
2.  **VFS Providers (Internal):** High-priority hooks that can intercept path navigation. For example, when you press `Enter` on a `.zip` or `.tar.gz` file, the **Archive Plugin** (an internal Go provider) intercepts the open request and transparently mounts a virtual file system *over* the archive. Similarly, the **NetFox (Network) Plugin** intercepts connection files in `net://` and mounts FTP/SFTP sessions.

To expose a VFS, an external plugin registers handlers for these requests:
*   `VFS.ReadDir`: Returns a list of `VFSItem` objects (Name, Size, IsDir, MTime).
*   `VFS.Stat`: Returns metadata for a single item.
*   `VFS.Open` / `VFS.ReadAt`: Returns a file handle ID and provides random-access byte reading. This enables f4's instant, zero-allocation Viewer and Editor to work over network or archive connections without downloading the whole file.
*   `VFS.Create` / `VFS.Write` / `VFS.MkDir` / `VFS.Remove` / `VFS.Rename`: Standard filesystem mutations.
*   `VFS.ProcessKey`: Allows the plugin to intercept specific keystrokes while the user is browsing its virtual drive.

### B. Searchable commands

`Plugin.Init` may also return a `Commands` array. Each descriptor contains a stable `ID`, `Location` (`0` for the panel plugin menu, `1` for plugin configuration), an English `Label` and optional `Description`, `Shortcut`, localized label/description maps, literal `SearchTerms`, and optional `ActiveDrives`. f4 shows these commands in its normal plugin menus and in the `Ctrl+Shift+P` command palette, indexes every supplied language, and renders the current interface language.

When the user selects a command, f4 calls `Plugin.RunCommand` with its ID. Contributions are tied to the RPC session and disappear when the plugin disconnects. `VFS.ProcessKey` and `Host.RegisterGlobalHotkey` remain supported for compatibility, but they carry no command name or search metadata; plugins should publish a matching command descriptor for every semantic operation reachable only through one of those raw-key callbacks.

The Go SDK exposes this as the optional `f4plugin.CommandProvider` interface, so existing plugins do not need to change. A user can select a command in the `F11` plugin menu and press `F4` to assign or change its f4 shortcut; the binding is stored in the profile's `hotkeys.ini`. See `plugins/dummy_rpc/main.go` for a drive-scoped, multilingual example.

### C. Editor Syntax Highlighting (Highlighter API)

Plugins can colorize files in the text editor dynamically.
1.  During initialization, the plugin calls `Host.RegisterHighlighter`.
2.  When `f4` opens a file, it starts sending lines to the plugin's `VFS.Highlight` endpoint.

**The `VFS.Highlight` Protocol:**
*   **Request Payload (`HighlightReq`):**
    *   `Line` (string): The raw text of the line to highlight.
    *   `Prev` (any): The state returned by the plugin after highlighting the *previous* line. This allows stateful, line-by-line parsing (e.g. tracking whether we are inside a multi-line comment block) without re-parsing the entire file.
    *   `Base` (uint64): The default terminal text attribute (colors).
*   **Response Payload (`HighlightRes`):**
    *   `Attrs` ([]uint64): A parallel array of terminal attribute words (colors/styles), one per rune of the line.
    *   `Next` (any): Any state object the plugin wants to pass to the next line's `Prev` parameter.

### D. Host Callbacks (Plugin -> Host)
Because F4-RPC is a full-duplex protocol, plugins can call back into `f4` at any time:
*   `Host.Log` / `Host.Message` / `Host.InputBox` / `Host.Menu`: Standard UI and debugging interactions.
    `Host.InputBox` and `Host.Menu` are refused with an error while f4's interface thread is itself waiting for the plugin (for example inside a `VFS.*` request): a dialog cannot be shown then, and waiting for it would freeze f4. Ask from a command or a hotkey handler instead.
*   `Host.Language`: returns the language codes to try, in order (the interface language, its fallback, then `en`), for a plugin that localizes its own dialogs and messages, the way command labels are localized. The language can change at run time, so ask when building a text.
*   `Host.RunAction`: Triggers any internal f4 semantic action (e.g., `Editor.Save`, `Panel.Swap`).
*   `Host.RunProgressTask` / `Host.UpdateProgress`: Safely offloads long-running plugin operations to f4's background job manager, displaying a progress dialog to the user with standard Cancel functionality.
*   `Host.AskOverwrite` / `Host.AskError`: Invokes f4's native, rich collision/error dialogs (Retry, Skip, Overwrite All, etc.) during mutations.
*   `Host.RegisterGlobalHotkey`: Registers a system-wide hotkey that triggers the plugin's `Plugin.OnHotkey` endpoint regardless of which panel is active.

### E. Panel-only plugins

A plugin does not have to mount a VFS to provide a full-screen panel surface.
Native Go plugins can opt into the optional `vfs.PanelContributionHost` and
register a `vfs.PanelProvider`. f4 publishes one searchable command for each
provider, labelled with its title. Opening it replaces the active file-panel surface
for that slot; the underlying `FileSystemPanel` remains alive as the logical
source for normal file actions.

The host calls the panel controller with the ordinary `vtui` drawing and input
interfaces. Before each draw and input event it supplies a `PanelContext` with
the panel side, screen bounds, active side, current path, cursor name, marked
names, and the corresponding snapshot from the other file panel. `Esc` and
plain `F10` close the panel when the controller does not consume them (F10 is
Quit elsewhere; under a panel plugin it returns to the file panel, and the
keybar caption says so). This keeps panel plugins
portable and prevents them from reaching into f4's private panel state.

A panel plugin's own keys go through one shared primitive instead of a
hand-written `ProcessKey` switch: the controller also implements
`vfs.PanelKeyProvider` and returns `[]vfs.PanelKey` -- virtual key,
modifiers, an already-localized keybar caption, a `Run` callback and an
optional `Enabled` predicate. While a panel plugin has the focus in the
active slot, f4 applies the same rules to every panel plugin, whether it
declares keys or not:

* a declared key runs before any global plugin hotkey or configured f4
  hotkey, including keys injected by a click on the keybar;
* bindings that act on the hidden file panel's cursor or selection (every
  `File.*` action, the group-selection actions and the file-panel navigation
  ones such as `Panel.GoParent`/`Panel.EnterDirectory` on Ctrl+PgUp/Ctrl+PgDn) and global plugin
  hotkeys stand down, so their keys reach the controller's `ProcessKey`
  instead; the hidden file panel itself never receives keys;
* the keybar shows the declared captions, blanks the file-panel captions and
  keeps every other f4 binding (Help, menus, panel toggles); F10 is captioned as closing the panel.

A folder bookmark taken while a panel plugin covers the directory remembers
that plugin (`Plugin=f4-panel:<provider ID>` in `bookmarks.ini`) and opens it
again over the directory. A controller that also implements
`vfs.PanelStateProvider` (`SavePanelState`/`RestorePanelState`, an opaque
one-line string such as the selected entry) gets its state stored in the
bookmark's `PluginData` and handed back after the panel reopens; state it does
not recognise must be ignored. A provider that is not registered on the
machine leaves the directory open and shows a message.

`vfs.DispatchPanelKey` is the host's dispatcher, exported so a controller can
route the same declarations from its own `ProcessKey`.

RPC plugins declare panel descriptors in the structured `Plugin.Init` result:

```text
Panels: [{ ID, Title, Description, Help, LocalizedHelp }]
```

`Help` is optional Markdown shown on F1 in f4's Markdown viewer, titled with the
panel's `Title`; `LocalizedHelp` maps language codes to translations and wins when
it has the interface language (then its fallback languages, then `en`). F1 is
captioned on the keybar. A panel that declares its own F1 key keeps it, and a panel
without help leaves F1 to f4's global Help.

The host then uses these calls lazily:

* `Plugin.OpenPanel` receives `{ ID, Context }` and returns a UTF-8 JSON `.vui`
  document in `Document`.
* `Plugin.PanelEvent` receives `{ ID, Kind, Event, Context }`, where `Kind` is
  `key` or `mouse`, and returns `{ Handled, Document, Close }`. `Document` is
  optional; when present it replaces the current widget tree.
* `Plugin.ClosePanel` receives `{ ID }` when the panel is dismissed.

An RPC panel declares its keys (the same `vfs.PanelKey` contract as in-process
panels, see above) by adding `Keys` and `HasKeys: true` to the `OpenPanel` and
`PanelEvent` answers. Each key is `{ VK, Mods, Label, Disabled }`; a declared
key is delivered as an ordinary `PanelEvent` of `Kind` `key`, and a `Disabled`
one is consumed by f4 without a call. f4 keeps the last declaration it
received (it never asks for it while drawing the keybar), so a plugin re-sends
the set with any answer after which it may differ; an answer without `HasKeys`
keeps it, and `HasKeys` with no `Keys` clears it. Plugins that never set
`HasKeys` behave exactly as before, and f4 builds that predate panel keys
ignore the fields. In Go, implement `f4plugin.PanelKeyProvider` next to
`f4plugin.PanelProvider`: the SDK attaches the set to every answer and also
consumes disabled keys under older f4 builds; `plugins/dummy_rpc` has a
counter panel that uses it.

The `.vui` document is rendered by the same `vtui` controls and wire format
used by the bindings in the `vtui` repository. The plugin owns semantic
behavior and may return a new document after any event; f4 owns placement,
focus routing, and panel context delivery. Existing VFS-only plugins continue
to use the legacy response shape unchanged.

## 3. Design Philosophy & Comparisons

If you are coming from the classic Far Manager ecosystem or modern text editors, here is how F4-RPC compares.

### f4 vs. Classic Far Manager (Far3 / far2l / far2m)
*   **Object Model:** Classic Far APIs are *UI-Centric*. A plugin receives raw console events, manually allocates arrays of `PluginPanelItem` C-structs, manages pointer lifecycles, and often hooks directly into the UI drawing loop. F4-RPC is *Data-Centric*. The plugin just returns arrays of standard data structures.
*   **Concurrency:** In classic Far, background operations often required complex threading hacks or blocked the main UI thread. In `f4`, *every* RPC call is inherently asynchronous. If `VFS.ReadDir` takes 5 seconds to fetch data from an FTP server, `f4` simply renders a `[ Loading... ]` placeholder and keeps the UI perfectly responsive.

### Escaping Technical Debt
Do we drag the technical debt of old Far APIs into f4? **No.**
F4-RPC is a completely clean-room, modern design. We intentionally abandoned the legacy C-struct memory model for plugins.
*Note:* We *do* provide a high degree of compatibility for Lua **Macros** (see `MACROS.md`), and we plan to implement a `far2l` Lua API compatibility shim. However, this shim will live entirely on the host side as a translation layer. The core plugin protocol remains strictly modern, decoupled, and free of legacy debt.

### f4 vs. Modern Code Editors (VS Code / Neovim)
The F4-RPC architecture is heavily inspired by modern editors.
*   **VS Code** uses the Language Server Protocol (LSP) over JSON-RPC.
*   **Neovim** uses MessagePack RPC for remote plugins.
Like them, `f4`'s out-of-process architecture ensures **Crash Isolation** (a segfault in your plugin will not kill the file manager), **Security** (WASM sandboxing), and **Language Agnosticism** (write plugins in Go, Python, or Lua).

## 4. Getting Started: Your First Plugin & Publishing

You don't need a compiler or complex SDKs to write your first plugin.

### Step 1: Scaffold the Plugin
Run the built-in generator:
```bash
f4 --new-plugin mydrive
```
This creates a directory named `mydrive` containing a `plugin.lua` and a `manifest.json`.

### Step 2: Understand and Test
Open `plugin.lua`. It contains a fully working, self-documented Virtual File System implemented in about 50 lines of Lua.
To load it:
1. Open `f4`, press `F9` -> **Options** -> **Manage plugins**.
2. Press `Insert` and point it to the `plugin.lua` you just generated.
3. Restart `f4`, press `Alt+F1`, and select **mydrive** from the drive menu.

### Step 3: Publish to PlugRing
Once you've built something cool, share it with the community via **PlugRing**:
1. Host your `.lua` or `.wasm` file somewhere accessible via HTTPS (e.g., GitHub Releases or raw Gists). *Do not publish compiled native binaries.*
2. Fork the `unxed/f4` repository.
3. Create a Markdown file in the `plugring/` directory (e.g., `plugring/mydrive.md`) containing YAML frontmatter and your description. Use the generated `manifest.json` as a guide.
4. Submit a Pull Request! (See `PLUGRING.md` for detailed rules).

## 5. Building a Native Plugin (Go SDK)

For Go developers building high-performance or complex native subprocess plugins, an SDK is provided in `sdk/f4plugin`. It handles all the MessagePack multiplexing and exposes a clean, synchronous Go interface. Check `plugins/dummy_rpc/main.go` for a reference implementation.

## Grouping virtual panels

Any ordinary file panel backed by a VFS supports the same independent Group by
modes as native panels. `sdk/f4plugin.VFSItem` includes the additive metadata
mask and optional physical size, times, permissions, ownership, Windows
attributes, link and extension flags. The numeric mask bits match `vfs`; set
`MetadataExplicit | MetadataUID` to report UID 0 without inventing other fields.
Old MessagePack/RPC and embedded Lua tables can omit these fields unchanged.
Unknown fields remain unknown; a nonempty `Mode` is an opaque grouping value.
See [VFS metadata availability](VFS.md#metadata-availability-and-panel-grouping).

The semantic panel model adds `groupBy`, `groupReverse`,
`groupFoldersSeparately`, `displayTop`, and `groups`. Each group contains `key`,
`title`, `startIndex`, and `count`. Ranges index the file-only `entries` array.
`cursor`, `top`, actions and counts still refer to real files; `top` is the first
file at or after the visual scroll origin. `displayTop` includes heading rows.

// The arithmetic and the decisions behind the layered overlay, kept apart from
// the syscalls so both can be tested on any platform.
//
// The overlay is a top-level window with no parent and no owner
// (docs/WINCON_805_HANDOVER.md step 3). That shape is what makes it safe --
// a child of another process's window couples the two input queues and freezes
// the console, measured in the field as F22 -- but it also means the window has
// to do for itself two things a child got for free: it must be told where the
// console is, and it must be told what the console looks like now. Both answers
// are computed here.

// premultiplyBGRA converts a top-down RGBA frame into the premultiplied BGRA
// that UpdateLayeredWindow requires, writing w*h*4 bytes into dst.
//
// Two conversions at once, and both matter. The byte order is Windows' (blue
// first), and every colour channel is scaled by its own alpha: a layered window
// blends with AC_SRC_ALPHA, which assumes the multiplication has already
// happened. Feeding it straight alpha makes translucent pixels too bright, and
// makes fully transparent ones show as a coloured haze rather than nothing --
// which on a console overlay looks like a dirty rectangle around the picture.

// The rules, in the order they can each cancel the ones below:
//
//   - a console that no longer exists ends the overlay, because a top-level
//     window is not destroyed with it the way a child was;
//   - a minimized or hidden console hides the picture: its client rectangle
//     still reports a size, so without this the overlay would sit over the
//     desktop showing a picture for a window nobody can see;
//   - a moved console moves the picture, since nothing repositions a
//     parentless window for us;
//   - and the overlay is kept directly above the console in the z-order, so
//     anything the user raises above the console covers the picture too. If
//     the window directly above is topmost, the overlay goes to the top of the
//     non-topmost band instead: matching a topmost window would put the
//     picture above every ordinary window on the desktop.

// the accounting, triage the tickets, drive the trains, one task, a report)
// does not fit one context well: unrelated steps clog it for each other. So a
// round first asks the model, without tools, to split the instruction into
// its steps; then each step runs in its own fresh agent dialog that sees only
// that step, the reports of the steps before it, and where to read the
// instruction itself. A plan of fewer than two steps runs the round whole.
